## [Unreleased]

## [4.0.0-rc.7] - 2025-12-12

### Added
- **Configurable PDFium linking for Rust crate** via Cargo features
  - `pdf-static`: Download and statically link PDFium (no runtime dependency)
  - `pdf-bundled`: Embed library in binary (self-contained executables)
  - `pdf-system`: Use system-installed PDFium via pkg-config
  - System installation scripts for Linux and macOS with pkg-config support
  - Runtime extraction module for bundled PDFium libraries
  - Comprehensive documentation in `docs/guides/pdfium-linking.md`
  - CI testing for system PDFium installation on Linux and macOS
  - Default behavior unchanged (backward compatible)
  - Language bindings continue to bundle PDFium automatically
- **WebAssembly bindings** (`@kreuzberg/wasm` npm package) for browser, Cloudflare Workers, Deno, and Bun
  - Full TypeScript API with sync and async extraction methods
  - Multi-threading support via `wasm-bindgen-rayon` and SharedArrayBuffer
  - Batch processing with `batchExtractBytes()` and `batchExtractBytesSync()`
  - Plugin system for custom post-processors, validators, and OCR backends
  - MIME type detection and configuration management
  - Comprehensive unit tests (95%+ coverage on core modules)
  - Production-ready error handling with detailed error messages
- RTF extractor now builds structured tables (markdown + cells) and parses RTF `\info` metadata (authors, dates, counts), bringing parity with DOCX/ODT fixtures.
- New pandoc-generated RTF fixtures with embedded metadata for `word_sample`, `lorem_ipsum`, and `extraction_test` to validate cross-format extraction.
- **Page tracking and metadata redesign** (#226)
  - Per-page content extraction with `PageContent` type
  - Byte-accurate page boundaries with `PageBoundary` type for O(1) lookups
  - Detailed per-page metadata with `PageInfo` type (dimensions, counts, visibility)
  - Unified page structure tracking with `PageStructure` type
  - `PageConfig` for controlling page extraction behavior
  - Automatic chunk-to-page mapping with `first_page`/`last_page` in `ChunkMetadata`
  - Format-specific support:
    - PDF: Full byte-accurate tracking with O(1) performance
    - PPTX: Slide boundary tracking
    - DOCX: Best-effort page break detection
  - Page markers in combined text for LLM context awareness

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: `ChunkMetadata` field renames for byte-accurate tracking (#226)
  - `char_start` → `byte_start` (UTF-8 byte offset)
  - `char_end` → `byte_end` (UTF-8 byte offset)
  - Existing code using `char_start`/`char_end` must be updated
  - See [migration guide](docs/migration/v3-to-v4.md#byte-offset-changes) for details

### Fixed
- Comprehensive lint cleanup across the crate and tests (clippy warnings resolved).
- Publish workflow now tolerates apt-managed RubyGems installations by skipping unsupported `gem update --system` during gem rebuild and installs a fallback .NET SDK when the runner lacks `dotnet`.
- Docker publish now skips pushing when the target version tag already exists, avoiding redundant builds for released images.
- Docker tag existence is checked upfront before any publish work, and per-variant publish jobs are skipped early when the version is already present.
- Added preflight checks for CLI, Go, and Rust crates to skip build/publish when the release artifacts already exist.
- Maven publishing now uses Sonatype Central's `central-publishing-maven-plugin` with auto-publish/wait and Central user-token credentials, replacing the legacy OSSRH endpoint.
- Maven Central publish timeout increased from 30 minutes to 2 hours to accommodate slower validation/publishing process.
- Python wheels are now built with `manylinux: auto` parameter (was incorrectly set to `manylinux2014` which is not a valid maturin-action value), fixing PyPI upload rejection of `linux_x86_64` platform tags.
- manylinux wheel builds now detect container type (CentOS vs Debian) and set correct `OPENSSL_LIB_DIR` paths (`/usr/lib64` for CentOS, `/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu` for Debian) to avoid openssl-sys build failures in maturin builds.
- Ruby Gemfile.lock now includes x86_64-linux platform for CI compatibility on Linux runners.
- Ruby gem corruption fixed by excluding .fastembed_cache (567MB of embedding models) and target directories from gemspec fallback path.
- Java Panama FFM SIGSEGV crashes on macOS ARM64 fixed by adding explicit padding fields to FFI structs (CExtractionResult and CBatchResult) to ensure struct alignment matches between Rust and Java.
- TypeScript E2E test type error fixed in smoke.spec.ts by using proper expectation object format.
- Node.js benchmarks now have tsx as workspace dev dependency and root-level typecheck script.
- C# compilation errors (CS0136, CS0128, CS0165) resolved by fixing variable shadowing in e2e/csharp/Helpers.cs.
- Python CI timeout issues resolved by marking slow office document tests with @pytest.mark.slow and skipping them in CI.
- Go CI tests enhanced with comprehensive verbose logging and platform-specific diagnostics for better debugging.

### API Changes

#### Core Extraction Functions

**Async-First Design**:
```python title="Python"
# Asynchronous extraction (recommended for I/O-bound operations)
result = await extract_file("document.pdf")
result = await extract_bytes(data, "application/pdf")
results = await batch_extract_files(["doc1.pdf", "doc2.pdf"])

# Synchronous variants (for simple scripts or non-async contexts)
result = extract_file_sync("document.pdf")
result = extract_bytes_sync(data, "application/pdf")
results = batch_extract_files_sync(["doc1.pdf", "doc2.pdf"])
```

**New TypeScript/Node.js API**:
```typescript title="TypeScript"
import { extractFile, extractFileSync, ExtractionConfig } from 'kreuzberg';

// Asynchronous extraction
const result = await extractFile('document.pdf');

// Synchronous extraction
const result = extractFileSync('document.pdf');

// Extraction with custom configuration (quality processing enabled)
const config = new ExtractionConfig({ enableQualityProcessing: true });
const result = await extractFile('document.pdf', null, config);
```

**Rust API**:
```rust title="Rust"
use kreuzberg::{extract_file, ExtractionConfig};

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> kreuzberg::Result<()> {
    // Initialize configuration with default settings
    let config = ExtractionConfig::default();
    // Perform asynchronous file extraction
    let result = extract_file("document.pdf", None, &config).await?;
    // Display extracted content
    println!("Extracted: {}", result.content);
    Ok(())
}
```

#### Configuration

**Strongly-Typed Configuration**:
- All configuration uses typed structs/classes (no more dictionaries)
- `ExtractionConfig`, `OcrConfig`, `ChunkingConfig`, etc.
- Compile-time validation of configuration options
- Better IDE autocomplete and type checking

**Configuration File Support**:
- TOML, YAML, and JSON configuration files
- Automatic discovery from current/parent directories
- `kreuzberg.toml`, `kreuzberg.yaml`, or `kreuzberg.json`
- CLI, API server, and MCP server all support config files

#### Result Types

**Enhanced ExtractionResult**:
```python title="Python"
@dataclass
class ExtractionResult:
    content: str
    mime_type: str
    metadata: Metadata  # Format-specific strongly-typed metadata
    tables: List[ExtractedTable]
    detected_languages: Optional[List[str]]  # Language detection results (v4 feature)
    chunks: Optional[List[str]]
```

**Strongly-Typed Metadata**:
- `PdfMetadata`, `ExcelMetadata`, `EmailMetadata`, `ImageMetadata`, etc.
- Type-safe access to format-specific metadata
- No more dictionary casting or key errors

### Plugin System

#### PostProcessors
```python title="Python"
from kreuzberg import register_post_processor, ExtractionResult

class MyPostProcessor:
    def name(self) -> str:
        return "my_processor"

    def process(self, result: ExtractionResult) -> ExtractionResult:
        # Apply custom transformations to extraction result
        return result

register_post_processor(MyPostProcessor())
```

#### Validators
```python title="Python"
from kreuzberg import register_validator, ExtractionResult

class MyValidator:
    def name(self) -> str:
        return "my_validator"

    def validate(self, result: ExtractionResult) -> None:
        # Enforce minimum content length requirement
        if len(result.content) < 10:
            raise ValidationError("Content too short")

register_validator(MyValidator())
```

#### Custom OCR Backends
```python title="Python"
from kreuzberg import register_ocr_backend

class CloudOCR:
    def name(self) -> str:
        return "cloud_ocr"

    def extract_text(self, image_bytes: bytes, language: str) -> str:
        # Send image to cloud OCR service and return extracted text
        return extracted_text

register_ocr_backend(CloudOCR())
```

### Performance

- **10-50x faster** text processing operations (streaming parsers)
- **Memory-efficient** streaming for multi-GB files
- **Parallel batch processing** with configurable concurrency
- **SIMD optimizations** for text processing hot paths
- **Zero-copy operations** where possible

### Breaking Changes from v3

#### Architecture
- **Rust core required**: Python package now includes Rust binaries (PyO3 bindings)
- **Binary wheels only**: No more pure-Python installation
- **Minimum versions**: Python 3.10+, Node.js 18+, Rust 1.75+

#### API Changes
- **Async-first API**: Primary API is now async, sync variants have `_sync` suffix
- **Configuration**: All config uses typed classes, not dictionaries
- **Metadata**: Strongly-typed metadata replaces free-form dictionaries
- **Function renames**: `extract()` → `extract_file()`, `extract_bytes()` is new
- **Batch API**: `batch_extract()` → `batch_extract_files()` with async support

#### Removed Features
- **Pure-Python API**: No longer available (use v3 for pure Python)
- **Old configuration format**: Dictionary-based config no longer supported
- **Legacy extractors**: Some Python-only extractors migrated to Rust
- **GMFT (Give Me Formatted Tables)**: Vision-based table extraction using TATR (Table Transformer) models removed
  - v3's GMFT used deep learning models for sophisticated table detection and parsing
  - Provided polars DataFrames, PIL Images, and multi-level header support
  - v4 replaces this with **native Tesseract-based table detection** (OCR-based, faster, simpler)
  - Configure via `TesseractConfig.enable_table_detection=True`
  - Returns `ExtractedTable` objects with cells (2D list) and markdown output
  - For advanced vision-based table extraction, use v3.x or specialized libraries
- **Entity Extraction (spaCy)**: Named entity recognition removed - use external NER libraries with postprocessors
- **Keyword Extraction (KeyBERT)**: Automatic keyword extraction removed - use external keyword extractors with postprocessors
- **Document Classification**: Automatic document type detection removed - use external classifiers with postprocessors

#### Migration Path
See [Migration Guide](https://docs.kreuzberg.dev/migration/v3-to-v4/) for detailed migration instructions.
