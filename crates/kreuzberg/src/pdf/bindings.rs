/// We cache the initialization state (lib_dir or error) rather than the bindings themselves.

/// `Box<dyn PdfiumLibraryBindings>`. Subsequent bindings are created quickly since
/// `extract_bundled_pdfium()` is cached internally via its own mutex.

/// # Performance
///
/// - **First call**: Performs extraction (8-12ms) and binding.
/// - **Subsequent calls**: Only creates new binding from cached state (< 0.1ms) since
