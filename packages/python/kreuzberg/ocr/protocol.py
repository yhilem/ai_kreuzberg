class OcrBackendProtocol(Protocol):
    """Protocol for OCR backends compatible with Rust FFI bridge.

    Python OCR backends implementing this protocol can be registered with the
    Rust extraction core using `register_ocr_backend()`. Once registered, they
    can be used by all extraction APIs (Python, Rust CLI, API server, MCP).

    Required Methods:
        name: Return backend name (e.g., 'easyocr', 'paddleocr')
        supported_languages: Return list of supported language codes
        process_image: Process image bytes and return extraction result

    Optional Methods:
        process_file: Process file from path (defaults to reading and calling process_image)
        initialize: Called when backend is registered (e.g., load models)
        shutdown: Called when backend is unregistered (e.g., cleanup resources)
        version: Return backend version string (defaults to '1.0.0')

    Example:
        >>> class MyOcrBackend:
        ...     def name(self) -> str:
        ...         return "my-ocr"

        ...         # Process image and extract text
        ...         return {
